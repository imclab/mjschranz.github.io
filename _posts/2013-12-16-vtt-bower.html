<p>
  Built distributions of <a href="https://github.com/andreasgal/vtt.js">vtt.js</a>
  are now available on <a href="https://github.com/bower/bower">Bower</a>.
  To install it you can either do: 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  bower install vtt.js
</pre>

<p>
  Or you can list it as a dependency in your <code>bower.json</code> file like so:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "vtt.js": "~0.3.0"
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
  If you don't want to use Bower and would rather build your own <code>vtt.js</code>
  you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/andreasgal/vtt.js">repo</a> and do:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  git submodule update --init --recursive && grunt build
</pre>

<p>
  For more info you can check out the <code>vtt.js</code> <a href="https://github.com/andreasgal/vtt.js#browser">README</a>.

<h3>Hosting Prebuilt vtt.js Distributions</h3>

<p>
  I encountered a problem getting <code>vtt.js</code> onto Bower; which was that Bower
  needs a git endpoint for your package that has the <em>final</em> version of your package in it.
  For JavaScript projects you would usually just point it at your GitHub
  repo and be done. However, we have a build step to get a version of <code>vtt.js</code>
  that is runnable in all browsers. This version contains polyfills for a lot of things
  that an old browser might not have, like <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#vttcue-interface">VTTCue</a>,
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#vttregion-interface">VTTRegion</a> and
  <a href="http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#api">TextDecoder</a>. Therefore, we can't just put
  the GitHub repo as an endpoint because then when you install the package you would still need to do another
  build step, which isn't ideal. What I've done instead is created a
  <a href="https://github.com/RickEyre/vtt.js-dist">vttj.s distribution repo</a> which
  we can point Bower at and get a working copy of <code>vtt.js</code> right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't the most ideal solution and there are probably better ones out there
  so if you know of one give me a shout!
